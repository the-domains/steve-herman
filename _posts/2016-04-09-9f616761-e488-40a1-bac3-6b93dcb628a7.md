The Philosophy of Steve Herman

__

_I vow to take
advantage of Life everyday by:_

Waking
up with a smile on my face;

Giving
selflessly to others;

Making
it a priority to give 110% in everything that I choose to endeavor;

Keeping
a positive mindset even in difficult situations; and

Knowing
that kindness towards others will make for the best in all!
