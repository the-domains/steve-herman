The Philosophy of Steve Herman: _I vow to take
advantage of Life everyday by: Waking
up with a smile on my face; Giving
selflessly to others; Making
it a priority to give 110% in everything that I choose to endeavor; Keeping
a positive mindset even in difficult situations; and Knowing
that kindness towards others will make for the best in all!_
