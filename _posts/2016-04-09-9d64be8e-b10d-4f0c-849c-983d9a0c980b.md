Philosophy Drives Attitude.

Attitude Drives Action.

Action Drives Results.

Results Drive Lifestyles.

If you don't like your lifestyles, look at your results.

If you don't like your results, look at your actions.

If you don't like your actions look at your attitude.

If you don't like you attitude,

Look at your Philosophy.
